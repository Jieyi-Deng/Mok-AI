## Slide 2: The Problem
**The Interview Gap: Anxiety, Cost, and Lack of Access**

*   **High Anxiety:** 93% of job seekers experience anxiety during interviews, which significantly impacts performance (Source: *[Standout CV](https://standout-cv.com/job-interview-anxiety-statistics)*). For students, this is compounded by fear of judgment and lack of experience.
*   **Prohibitive Costs:** Traditional career coaching and mock interview services are expensive, averaging **$100-$150 per hour** (Source: *[Quenza](https://quenza.com/blog/career-coaching-prices/)*, *[MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/blog/career-coach-cost/)*). This is unaffordable for most students.
*   **Generic Feedback:** Free alternatives (friends, generic AI tools) often lack specific, actionable feedback tailored to the candidate's specific resume and the target job description.
*   **Limited Access:** University career centers are often overbooked and understaffed, leaving students without timely support during peak recruiting seasons.

2.  **Target:** Candidate pastes the Job Description (JD) they are applying for.
3.  **Simulate:** AI conducts a realistic, voice-based or text-based mock interview tailored to the specific role and candidate profile.
4.  **Learn:** Receive instant, granular feedback on answers, delivery, and resume gaps.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features:**
*   **Resume & JD Parsing:** Automatically extracts key skills and requirements to generate relevant questions.
*   **AI Interviewer Bot:** Conducts a structured 15-30 minute interview (Behavioral & Technical basics).
*   **Smart Feedback Engine:** Provides a score and specific suggestions for improvement (e.g., "Your answer to the conflict question lacked a clear resolution. Use the STAR method.").
*   **Iteration Mode:** Allows users to re-do specific questions to practice improvements immediately.
*   **Freemium Model:** Basic interviews are free; deep analytics and unlimited practice are affordable (e.g., $10/month).

## Slide 6: Competitors
**Competitive Landscape**

| Feature | **Mok/AI** | **Human Career Coaches** | **Peer-to-Peer (e.g., Pramp)** | **Generic AI (e.g., ChatGPT)** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Cost** | **Low ($)** | High ($$$) | Free/Low | Low ($) |
| **Availability** | **24/7 On-Demand** | Appointment Based | Scheduled/Matched | 24/7 |

**Key Competitors:**
*   **Interviewing.io:** High quality but expensive ($100s/session), focuses on experienced engineers. *Gap: Too pricey for students.*
*   **Pramp:** Free peer-to-peer. *Gap: Feedback quality depends on the other student; scheduling friction.*
*   **Interview Warmup (Google):** Free, good for basics. *Gap: Generic, not deeply tailored to specific uploaded resumes or complex JDs.*
*   **Final Round AI / Yoodli:** Strong AI competitors. *Differentiation: Mok/AI focuses specifically on the "Student/Entry-Level" niche with affordability and resume-specific tailoring as the primary hook, rather than general communication coaching.*
